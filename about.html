	<h1> Peter Kim | Bio </h1>

<p>As you can see from above, my name is Peter Kim. Currrently enrolled at Eastern Washington University, I am two quarters away from graduating with a degree in communications with an emphasis in public relations. I will also be earning an EMT certification by June. With that, I will be qualified to apply to many firefighter stations. I hope to be a firefighter in Seattle some day and during my off days, be a personal trainer. I enjoy being a service to others and often put other people's needs over mine. Although my plan is to live in Seattle, I enjoy the lemons life throws at me therefore I'll continue to make lomondae.   </p>

<p>I will graduate with a degree in Communications with an emphasis in public relations and two minors coaching and sociology. </p>
